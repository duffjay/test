 * hello world version 2 
 * - i changed it to pass a custom data structure through the callbacks
 *   similar to gstreamer
 * a) define the structure
 * b) define the callback header definitions to reflect the structure (they were NULL)
 * c) pass it in (as a pointer) on the call back connection
 * d) consume them in the functions
 *    data->var1 = 2
 * 
 * added to makefile 2
